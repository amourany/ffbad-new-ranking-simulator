# Badminton Match Simulator – FFBaD 2025–2026 Ranking System

This React-based application simulates badminton matches between two players or pairs and calculates the ranking points gained or lost based on the result, following the official classification system defined by the FFBaD (Fédération Française de Badminton) for the 2025–2026 season.

The new ranking system will be effective from **September 4, 2025**, and the previous rankings will be converted into the new format. This app also lets you simulate that conversion to preview your updated ranking.

## 🚀 Features

- Simulate **men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles**, and **mixed doubles**
- Support for **cross-gender matches** (e.g., men's pair vs. women's pair), introduced in the 2025–2026 system
- Calculate point gains or losses for each player/pair
- Simulate the **conversion** of old rankings to the 2025–2026 system
- Uses the official FFBaD ranking rules
